## Apache ShardingSphere is included in CNCF Landscape

### CNCF

(Cloud Native Computing Foundation)，is a cloud native computing open source software foundation founded by Google. It is committed to the popularization and sustainable development of Cloud Native technology. Cloud native technology helps enterprises and organizations to build and run agile and scalable applications in modern dynamic environments (such as public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds) through a series of software, specifications, and standards. The representative cloud-native technologies are containers, microservices, microservice governance, and declarative APIs, etc.

### CNCF Landscape

(https://github.com/cncf/landscape) is an important project in CNCF. It aims to provide a resource map for cloud native users to help enterprises and developers quickly understand the overall picture of the cloud native system.

The CNCF divides the cloud-native ecosystem into five layers horizontally, and plans two parts vertically for them as a common layer of five horizontal layers. The five horizontal divisions are: application definition and development, orchestration and governance, runtime, supply assurance, and cloud facilities. The two parts divided vertically are: observation and analysis and platform. Integrating these functions is a perfect cloud platform service product, the panorama is as follows：

### ShardingSphere

On June 28, 2019, Beijing time, Apache ShardingSphere entered CNCF Landscape. It has a place in the panorama App Definition Development-Database field, as shown below.

Apache ShardingSphere will continue to expand and improve in the open source and cloud native areas, and build an organic open source ecosystem!

We also hope that more enthusiasts of the open source and cloud native communities can join us and move forward together to promote the common growth of the Apache ShardingSphere community and contributors!
