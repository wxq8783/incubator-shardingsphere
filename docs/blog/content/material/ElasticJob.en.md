## News! The distributed scheduling project ElasticJob is about to restart

ElasticJob is a distributed scheduling solution that provides sharding of distributed tasks, elastic scaling, fully automatic discovery, lavish task types based on time-driven, data-driven, resident tasks and temporary tasks, task aggregation and dynamic resource allocation, fault detection, automatic repair, failover and retry. Perfect operation & maintenance platform and management tools as well as good support for cloud native can fully meet the needs of enterprises for task management and batch processing scheduling and processing capabilities.

Since ElasticJob has been open sourced at the end of 2014, it has been more than 5 years. With its rich features, comprehensive documentation, high-quality code and ease of use of the framework, it has accumulated a large number of loyal users and a good industry reputation (5.8K star). It has been one of the most popular projects in the field of distributed scheduling framework.

In the past two years, ElasticJob has slowed down its development due to core developers' efforts to develop and maintain the Apache ShardingSphere project. However, with the continuous expansion of the Apache ShardingSphere project in the distributed field and the user demands for functions such as distributed management of multiple data cluster environments and elastic expansion of data migration, a powerful distributed scheduling component is required. As a result, the Apache ShardingSphere community has planned to initiate a proposal to use ElasticJob as its subproject for continuous update and maintenance.

We made this good news public for the first time and we will bring more information about ElasticJob in the future.
